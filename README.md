SCCS2014
========

ipython notebook to accompany 2A) The Power of Model Validation for SCCS2014 (http://sccs2014.soton.ac.uk)

This is a file created with the ipython notebooks. The code is in Python (2.7), and should be portable. Unfortunately the data is not, but similar datasets are available (for inspiration see example data used here: http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/examples.html)

Note: These are only examples, and due care should be taken when applying to your respective research questions! Feel free to contact Martin or me with any questions.

Best wishes,
